                Fullstack web development has always been something I was fascinated with. As an adult,
                I have been given time to pursue things I am passionate about. Learning to create articulate, beautiful,
                and highly functional web applications was high on that list and now I am committed to a career as a developer.
                Self taught, self motivated and always striving for the best for family and myself, I hope you enjoy my projects as 
                much as I enjoyed programming them! Cheers!
